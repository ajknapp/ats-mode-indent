This is a temporary hosting place for my version of ATS mode.

I've added mostly functional smart indentation by cannibalizing sml.el.
The only problem I've found after a few months of sporadic use is excessive indentation after ending a function without a semicolon.
The code indents way too far to the right, but this can be fixed by terminating functions with a semicolon.

Maybe someone who knows more about grammars can fix this (my background is in mathematics.)
